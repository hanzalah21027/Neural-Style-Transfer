# Neural Style Transfer

The Neural Style Transfer project is a web application that uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to apply the style of a chosen artwork to a user-provided image. It was developed using Flask, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Python, and PyTorch and includes features such as user login, signup, and the ability to share the generated images on social media platforms. It allow users to choose from four different styles: Ukiyoe, Monet, Cezanne, and Vangogh. The project was completed by Hanzalah Firdausi, Lasani Hussain, and Ankit Kuswah as part of their final project for Data Processing and Management coursework (ECE 560). We thank Dr. Pravesh Biyani and course TAs for their supervision.

Please refer to the paper [style transfer.pdf](https://github.com/hanzalah21027/Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/main/style%20transfer.pdf) for detailed explanation on the architecture, training regime, and results of the models created.

The Training files are train.ipynb and train.py and the remaining code such as Network architrecture and dataloader, etc for training are in the folder "model".

Please refer to the link [Model Weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19he_CLhXuMGcsjq1wCIlKjo0FQtqXrjk/view?usp=share_link) for saved model weights.

The WebApp code is in the folder "WebApp".
